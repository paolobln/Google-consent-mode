## Consent Mode

This repo aims to be an easy and understandable guide to the implementation of the [Consent Mode](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10000067?hl=en) by Google if you are using your own cookie banner.
There are three files:
1. **consent.html** is an HTML page that show the logic behind the consent mode
2. **GTM_consentMode.json** it is a Google Tag Manager container that can be [imported](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106997?hl=en#import) in your GTM account
3. **consentMode.md** explains two ways to implement this feature if you are using your own cookie banner
